Upgrade the releaser agent to use Claude Sonnet instead of Haiku for improved reliability and constraint adherence. Add a "Follow the Process" section that explicitly instructs the agent to use the `tenzir-changelog` CLI and `/changelog:release` command rather than bypassing the workflow with direct `gh` or `git tag` commands, ensuring consistent and safe release practices.
