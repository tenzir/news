Documented composability principle for subagents and slash commands. Clarified that subagents should invoke slash commands and add only orthogonal concerns (argument validation, autonomous decisions, error handling) rather than duplicating the command's workflow logic. Added a table distinguishing responsibilities between slash commands and subagents, with examples of good vs bad patterns.
