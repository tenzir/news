# Review Changes

Spawn specialized reviewers in parallel to analyze changes.

## 1. Setup (via hook)

A scope detection hook runs automatically before the first tool call. It outputs:

- `Scope: <description>` — what's being reviewed
- `Diff: <command>` — git diff command base (append files to run)
- File list, one per line

The review directory is created automatically when the first reviewer starts
writing findings (via a hook in the `reviewing-changes` skill).

To review a different scope, stage or unstage changes and run the command again.

## 2. Detect PR and Explore Context

### Check for PR

Check if the current branch has an associated pull request:

```sh
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null
```

Note whether a PR exists—this determines if the GitHub reviewer should be spawned.

### Explore Project Context

Launch the Explore agent to gather project context before spawning reviewers.

Prompt:

> Briefly describe this project for code reviewers. Check the repository root
> for config files (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, Dockerfile, etc.)
> and skim the README intro.
>
> Return 2-3 sentences describing:
>
> - What the project is and does
> - Key characteristics relevant to code review (e.g., static site generator,
>   CLI tool, library, web service, build tooling)

Wait for the agent to complete and capture its output.

## 3. Spawn Reviewers

### Security Note

The GitHub reviewer uses `gh` CLI which inherits your authentication. Only run
on repositories you trust. If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set (e.g., in CI), the reviewer
gains those permissions.

### Launch Reviewers

Launch reviewer agents in parallel using the Task tool (GitHub reviewer only if
PR exists). Pass the project context from the Explore agent, file list, and
review directory:

- `@dev:reviewers:ux` - User experience, clarity, discoverability
- `@dev:reviewers:docs` - Documentation quality, accuracy
- `@dev:reviewers:tests` - Test coverage, edge cases
- `@dev:reviewers:arch` - API design, modularity, complexity
- `@dev:reviewers:security` - Input validation, injection, secrets
- `@dev:reviewers:readability` - Naming quality, idiomatic patterns, clarity
- `@dev:reviewers:performance` - Performance, complexity, resource efficiency
- `@dev:reviewers:github` - GitHub PR comments from humans and bots (only if PR exists)

Pass each reviewer a prompt constructed from hook outputs:

- File list and diff command base from `Diff:` line (append files to complete)
- Review directory from `Review directory:` line
- Replace `<reviewer>` with reviewer name (e.g., `security`, `ux`)

Template:

> ## Project
>
> Description about the project, allowing for calibration of relevance of
> findings.
>
> ## Scope
>
> Review changes in: `src/foo.ts`, `src/bar.ts`
>
> Diff command:
>
> ```sh
> git diff --cached -- src/foo.ts src/bar.ts
> ```
>
> ## Workflow
>
> 1. Run the diff command above to see the changed hunks
> 2. Focus your review on the changes shown in the diff
> 3. Read full file context only when needed to understand changes
> 4. Report line numbers from the original file, not diff output
>
> Note: With unstaged scope, files with no diff output are untracked (new)—review
> them in full.
>
> ## Findings
>
> Write findings to: `<review_dir>/<reviewer>.md`

Wait for all reviewers to complete.

## 4. Synthesize Findings

Read all `<review_dir>/*.md` files. You now have context that individual
reviewers lacked: all findings together, project context, and user intent.

Use this to distill actionable items:

### Deduplicate

You should merge findings that flag the same location from different reviewers.
Multiple reviewers flagging the same area signals importance—note this when
presenting.

### Correlate

You should group related findings that touch the same subsystem or share a root
cause. Addressing one may resolve others.

When GitHub reviewer feedback (GIT findings) aligns with automated reviewer
findings, this signals higher priority—human reviewers independently identified
the same concern.

### Prioritize

Given the project context and scope, determine what matters most:

- P1/P2 findings generally take precedence
- High confidence (90%+) signals strong evidence
- Multiple reviewers flagging related issues amplifies priority
- Consider user's likely intent from the review scope

### Select

Choose the top findings to present. Not everything needs action—filter noise,
keep signal. Aim for a focused list the user can reasonably address.

## 5. Display Findings

Present the synthesized findings.

For GitHub findings, include author attribution: `💬 GIT-1 · {title} (@{author})`

Sort by urgency: severity (P1→P4), then confidence (descending).

## 6. Prompt to Address

If **findings exist**:

> 📁 Full findings: `<review_dir>/`
>
> Address these? (**yes** to enter plan mode)

If user responds **yes**:

1. Enter plan mode with findings as context
2. Re-read full reviewer outputs (`<review_dir>/*.md`) for reasoning, evidence,
   and suggestions—the summary is a distillation, not the full picture
3. Generate implementation plan ordered by severity (P1 first)
4. Group fixes by file to minimize context switches

If user responds **no** or **no findings**:
