# Technical Writing

Write clear, consistent technical documentation based on Google's developer
documentation style guide.

## Core Principles

- **Clarity over cleverness**: Prioritize understandable prose over elegant
  writing
- **Consistency matters**: Apply rules uniformly throughout a document
- **Audience-first**: Write for developers with varying English proficiency

## Voice and Tone

**Use second person**: Address the reader directly with "you."

Good: "You can configure the server by editing `config.yaml`."
Bad: "We can configure the server by editing `config.yaml`."

**Use active voice**: Make clear who performs the action.

Good: "The function returns an error code."
Bad: "An error code is returned by the function."

**Be conversational but professional**: Write naturally without slang, jargon,
or excessive formality. Use common contractions like "you're," "don't," and
"it's" to maintain an informal tone.

## What to Avoid

- **Jargon and buzzwords**: "leverage," "utilize," "synergy"
- **Filler phrases**: "please note that," "it should be noted"
- **Exclamation marks**: Reserve for genuinely exciting moments
- **Implying simplicity**: "simply," "just," "easy" (frustrates struggling
  readers)
- **Latin abbreviations**: Write "for example" not "e.g.", "that is" not "i.e."
- **Directional language**: Use "earlier/later" not "above/below"
- **Anthropomorphic language**: Don't attribute human qualities to software
  ("the system wants," "the server thinks")
- **Skipping articles**: Always include "a," "an," and "the"—even in headings

## Inclusive Language

| Avoid               | Use Instead                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| blacklist/whitelist | denylist/allowlist, blocklist/safelist |
| master/slave        | primary/replica, leader/follower       |
| man-hours           | person-hours                           |
| guys                | everyone, folks, team                  |
| sanity check        | quick check, coherence check           |

## Capitalization

- **Sentence case** for headings: Capitalize only the first word and proper
  nouns
- **Product names**: Always capitalize (Tenzir, Kubernetes, Docker)
- **Acronyms**: Use standard capitalization (API, HTTP, JSON)

## Headings

- **Task headings**: Use bare infinitives ("Create an instance")
- **Concept headings**: Use noun phrases ("User authentication")
- **Hierarchy**: Don't skip levels (h1 to h3 without h2)
- **No links**: Avoid hyperlinks within headings

## Lists

**Numbered lists**: For sequential steps or ordered items.

**Bulleted lists**: For non-sequential items.

**List guidelines**:

- Introduce with a complete sentence followed by a colon
- Start each item with a capital letter
- Use parallel structure across items
- End with periods if items contain verbs or are complete sentences
- Don't use single-item lists

## Procedures

**Structure**:

1. Introduce with context
2. Number each step
3. Start steps with imperative verbs
4. State location before action

**Guidelines**:

- "In the Settings panel, click **Save**." (location before action)
- Mark optional steps with "Optional:" at the start
- Document one accessible procedure, not multiple alternatives
- Avoid "please" in instructions

## Code in Text

**Use code font** (backticks) for:

- Command-line input and output
- Filenames and paths
- Class, method, and function names
- Keywords, variables, and parameters
- HTTP status codes and methods

**Don't use code font** for:

- Product names and services
- URLs meant to be followed in a browser
- Domain names

**Grammar**: Don't inflect code elements. Write "send a `POST` request" not
"`POST` the data."

## Word Choices

| Avoid                   | Use Instead                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| aka                     | also known as, or use parentheses |
| allows you to           | lets you                          |
| config                  | configuration                     |
| admin                   | administrator                     |
| click on                | click                             |
| check (checkbox)        | select                            |
| uncheck                 | clear                             |
| higher/lower (versions) | later/earlier                     |

## Formatting

- **UI elements**: Bold (**File > Save**)
- **User input**: Code font or bold, depending on context
- **New terms**: Italics on first use
- **Emphasis**: Use sparingly; prefer restructuring sentences

## Links

- Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
- Avoid "click here" or "this page"
- Good: "See the [authentication guide](...)."
- Bad: "Click [here](...) for more information."

## Reference Hierarchy

When style questions arise, consult in order:

1. Project-specific guidelines
2. Google Developer Documentation Style Guide
3. Merriam-Webster (spelling)
4. Chicago Manual of Style (general)
5. Microsoft Writing Style Guide (technical)
