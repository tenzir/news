Introduces the `/docs:review` command to review documentation changes for completeness and style. The command:

- Identifies changes in the `.docs/` directory
- Starts the local preview server for live verification
- Checks completeness using the `docs:writing` skill
- Reviews writing style using the `prose:technical-writing` skill
- Summarizes findings and offers to fix identified issues

This integrates seamlessly into the documentation workflow as the second step after `/docs:write`.
