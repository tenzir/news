title: Docs Plugin v1.1.0
intro: >-
  This release introduces autonomous documentation workflows with the new `/docs:review`
  command and `docs:writer` subagent. The plugin now uses `.docs` as the unconditional
  documentation root and streamlines command naming by renaming `/docs:write-docs`
  to `/docs:write`.
