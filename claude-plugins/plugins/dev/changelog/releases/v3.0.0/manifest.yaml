title: Unified Developer Utilities
intro: >-
  This release consolidates developer utilities into a unified plugin. The docs,

  prose, and ship plugins have merged into dev, providing changelog management,

  code review, and documentation workflows in one place.


  The new `/dev:review` command spawns seven specialized reviewers in parallel to

  analyze code changes with confidence-scored findings. Release workflows moved to

  `/dev:release` and `/dev:finalize`. Documentation synchronization now works

  across all doc commands with automatic worktree isolation.
