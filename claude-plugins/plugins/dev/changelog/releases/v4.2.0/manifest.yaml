title: Remote Release Workflows
intro: >-
  This release adds remote release workflow detection to `/dev:release`, letting you
  trigger GitHub Actions workflows instead of running local release steps. It also
  modularizes the documentation editing architecture and improves issue identifier
  guidance in the PR maker agent.
