title: Workflow Automation Improvements
intro: >-
  This release improves workflow automation for changelog creation and code review.

  The changelog-adder agent now auto-detects changed files and provides clearer

  guidance for writing user-focused entries. The review command streamlines

  decision points, reducing prompts while maintaining control over important

  choices.
