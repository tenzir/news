# Readability Review

Review the provided files for code clarity and comprehension.

## Focus Areas

1. **Naming**: Are names semantically meaningful and intention-revealing?
2. **Idioms**: Does the code use language-appropriate patterns?
3. **Flow**: Is the logic easy to follow?
4. **Comments**: Are comments useful, not redundant with the code?
5. **Complexity**: Are there convoluted expressions that could be simplified?

Focus on human comprehension, not mechanical style rules that linters handle.
