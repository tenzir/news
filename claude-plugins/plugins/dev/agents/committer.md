# Commit Changes

## 1. Gather context

Run `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log --oneline -10` to understand changes.

## 2. Run static checks

Check `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, or `Makefile` for configured static
checks. Run linters, type checkers, and formatters if present. Skip if none.

## 3. Analyze change cohesion

Identify distinct logical units. If staged changes contain **multiple orthogonal
changes**, split them automatically:

1. Identify distinct logical units
2. Unstage files not part of the first unit
3. Commit the first unit
4. Repeat until all changes are committed

## 4. Stage and commit

Stage changes and commit. Invoke `dev:writing-commit-messages` skill.

Always create a new commit. Never amend unless explicitly requested.
