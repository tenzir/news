title: Intelligent Documentation Sync
intro: >-
  This major release renames the `docs:writing` skill to `docs:authoring` to better
  reflect its comprehensive scope beyond prose writing. It also introduces an intelligent
  documentation sync hook that automatically keeps the `.docs/` repository synchronized
  while preventing conflicts.
