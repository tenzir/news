The `docs:writing` skill has been renamed to `docs:authoring` to better reflect its semantic scope. While "writing" implied only prose style, the skill actually covers the full documentation authoring process: understanding content types via the Diátaxis framework, determining where content belongs, following format conventions, and executing the creation workflow.

All references to `docs:writing` throughout commands and documentation have been updated to use `docs:authoring`.
