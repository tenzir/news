title: Enhanced Documentation PR Workflow
intro: >-
  This release restores the `/docs:pr` command with enhanced cross-referencing capabilities
  that automatically link documentation PRs with parent project PRs. It also improves
  the synchronization workflow by automatically cloning the documentation repository
  when needed, eliminating manual setup steps.
