title: Documentation Reader Bug Fixes
intro: >-
  This release fixes two bugs in the documentation reader subagent. The reader now
  reports all examples from operator and function pages instead of only the first
  one, and only reports verbatim examples from the documentation instead of synthesizing
  potentially incorrect code.
