The changelog bot now displays PR comment suggestions with cleaner typography. Reaction options appear in a smaller, lighter font with middle dot separators instead of pipes, and command argument hints use the same elegant separator style.

The comment footer reads "This changelog was automatically generated. React to proceed:" followed by emoji reactions, making it clearer that the suggestions are automated and actionable.
