The `/changelog:add` command and managing-entries skill documentation have been improved with corrected tenzir-changelog CLI usage. The `--root` flag is now positioned before the `add` subcommand, and output examples have been updated to use the `--json` flag for structured data instead of `--markdown`. These changes ensure users follow the correct CLI syntax and prefer machine-readable output formats.
