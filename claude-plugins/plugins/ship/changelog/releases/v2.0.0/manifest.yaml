title: Plugin Rebrand
intro: >-
  This major release rebrands the plugin from "changelog" to "ship" to better reflect
  its broader focus on release engineering. Commands have been updated from `/changelog:add`
  and `/changelog:release` to `/ship:add` and `/ship:release`, and all CLI invocations
  now use `tenzir-ship` instead of `tenzir-changelog`.
