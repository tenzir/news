title: Two-Dimensional Code Reviews
intro: >-
  This release improves code reviews with a two-dimensional rating system that separates
  severity from confidence. It also adds support for Claude Code plugin and Node.js
  project types during releases, and saves review output persistently in a hierarchical
  directory structure.
