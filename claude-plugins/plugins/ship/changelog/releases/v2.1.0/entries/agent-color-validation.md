The validation script now enforces valid agent color values, ensuring that agent frontmatter only uses supported colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan).

The finalizer agent color changed from magenta to red to comply with the validation requirements. This ensures consistent agent appearance across the marketplace.
