title: Autonomous Workflows
intro: >-
  This release enhances the changelog commands with autonomous decision-making capabilities.
  Both `/changelog:add` and `/changelog:release` now run in forked contexts that infer
  parameters from repository context and proceed without user confirmation, streamlining
  the changelog and release workflows.
