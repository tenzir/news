This release improves the accuracy of the `/changelog:add` command documentation by using correct terminology and clarifying configuration file locations.

## 🐞 Bug fixes

### More accurate terminology in changelog add command

The `/changelog:add` command documentation now uses the correct terminology "invoked" instead of "loaded" when referring to skills, and clarifies that the `modules:` configuration is found in the project's `changelog/config.yaml` rather than vaguely referring to "parent `config.yaml`". This makes the instructions more accurate and easier to follow.
