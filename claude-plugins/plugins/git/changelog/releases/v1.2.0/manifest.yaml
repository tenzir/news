title: PR Review Comment Addressing
intro: >-
  This release introduces the `/git:address-pr-comments` command for systematically
  working through GitHub PR review comments. The command creates one commit per comment,
  replies with the commit SHA, and resolves threads automatically. It also includes
  fixes for branch pushing before PR creation and multi-line review comment support.
