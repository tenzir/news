title: Pull Request Workflow
intro: >-
  This release adds the new `/git:pr` command for creating GitHub pull requests directly
  from Claude Code. The command integrates with `/git:commit` to streamline the workflow
  from staging changes to opening a PR. Additionally, `/git:commit` has been simplified
  by removing changelog and version bump steps, which are now handled separately via
  `/changelog:add` and `/changelog:release`.
