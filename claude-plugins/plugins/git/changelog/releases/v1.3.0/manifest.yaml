title: Autonomous Commit Workflows
intro: >-
  This release introduces autonomous commit workflows that automatically split unrelated
  changes into separate commits without prompting. The new `/git:address-pr-comments`
  command systematically addresses GitHub PR review comments, creating commits and
  resolving threads automatically. The commit workflow now includes expanded static
  checks (linters, type checkers, formatters) before staging changes. Several bugfixes
  improve multi-line review comment handling and branch pushing reliability.
