intro: >-
  This release introduces the `tql:writing-programs` skill, which provides TQL language
  fundamentals and spawns the `docs:reader` subagent for live documentation lookup.
  This helps guide you through writing correct TQL programs by providing language
  foundations upfront and on-demand reference material.
