title: Parser and OCSF Mapping Workflows
intro: >-
  This release introduces two new slash commands for creating Tenzir packages:

  `/tql:make_parser` for building parsing pipelines from sample log data, and

  `/tql:make_ocsf_mapping` for adding OCSF mappings to existing parsers. Both

  commands provide guided, multi-phase workflows with iterative testing support.
