The `tenzir:guide` subagent provides fast, accurate answers to Tenzir questions by searching the local documentation. Use it to ask about TQL pipelines, operators, functions, node configuration, platform setup, and integrations. The agent leverages the `tenzir:docs` skill to navigate documentation and synthesize responses with citations, eliminating the need to manually search through documentation files.
