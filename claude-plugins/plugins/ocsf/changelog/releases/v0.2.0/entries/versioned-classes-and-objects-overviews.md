Classes and objects now have version-specific overview documentation, following the same pattern established for profiles. The static `classes.md` and `objects.md` files contain only conceptual guidance, while the generator creates `classes-overview.md` and `objects-overview.md` in `references/<version>/` with complete listings for each OCSF version. This ensures the skill documentation stays accurate as classes and objects are added or modified across OCSF releases.
