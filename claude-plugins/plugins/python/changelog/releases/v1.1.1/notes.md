This release expands the Python conventions skill with guidance on default libraries (pydantic, FastAPI, Click), package structure best practices, and testing patterns with pytest.

## 🔧 Changes

### Expanded Python conventions guidance

The Python conventions skill now includes expanded guidance on default libraries, package structure, and testing practices. The skill recommends using pydantic for models, FastAPI for REST APIs, and Click for CLI interfaces to maintain consistency across Tenzir repositories. New sections cover package structure best practices, including keeping `__init__.py` files empty and using absolute imports, as well as unit testing conventions with pytest, CliRunner, and parametrization patterns.
