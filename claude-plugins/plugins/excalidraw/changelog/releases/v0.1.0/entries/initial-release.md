The Excalidraw plugin generates valid `.excalidraw` JSON files for flowcharts, ER diagrams, sequence diagrams, and architecture diagrams. The `excalidraw:diagramming` skill produces properly structured diagrams with all element types (shapes, text, arrows, lines, images, frames, and custom polygons), correct bindings between elements, and consistent styling using Excalidraw's color palettes and fill patterns.
