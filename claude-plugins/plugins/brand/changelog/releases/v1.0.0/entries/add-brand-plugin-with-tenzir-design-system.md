The brand plugin provides Tenzir's design system specifications for frontend development.

The `styling-tenzir-ui` skill includes:

- **Design tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and border radius
- **Component specs**: Buttons, inputs, dropdowns, tags, badges, toasts, and 10+ more UI components
- **CSS custom properties**: Ready-to-use variables including `--primary-*` and `--secondary-*` aliases
- **Tailwind configuration**: Drop-in config snippets for immediate integration

When working on frontend code, Claude will reference the appropriate design tokens and component specifications to ensure consistent styling across Tenzir products.
