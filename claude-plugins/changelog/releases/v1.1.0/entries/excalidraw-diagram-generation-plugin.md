Generate valid Excalidraw diagrams with the new `excalidraw:diagramming` skill.
The skill provides comprehensive reference documentation for all element types
(shapes, text, arrows, lines, freedraw, images, frames, polygons) and styling
properties (colors, fill patterns, positioning, grouping). All values and
constants are derived from the Excalidraw source code, ensuring compatibility
with excalidraw.com and VS Code extensions.
