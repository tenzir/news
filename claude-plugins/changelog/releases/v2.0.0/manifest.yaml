title: Ship Plugin
intro: >-
  This major release renames the `changelog` plugin to `ship` to better reflect its
  focus on release engineering. Subagents now require explicit skill declarations
  in their YAML frontmatter, and tool configurations have been updated to use the
  consolidated `Skill` tool.
