Rename skills and update descriptions to trigger on artifact detection rather than specific user queries:

- `writing-python-code` → `python-conventions`: triggers on Python repository or `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`/`ruff.toml`/`.py` files
- `managing-changelogs` → `changelog-management`: triggers on changelog questions or `changelog/` directory
