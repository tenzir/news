title: First Stable Release
intro: >-
  This is the first stable release of the Tenzir Claude Marketplace, a collection
  of plugins that extend Claude Code's capabilities for working with the Tenzir ecosystem.


  This release introduces fully qualified skill names across all plugins for clarity
  and consistency. The `writing` plugin has been renamed to `prose` to better reflect
  its purpose, and the auto-update plugin has been removed in favor of manual updates.
  The CI now validates all skills using the official Agent Skills specification.
