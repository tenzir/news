The `tenzir:guide` subagent now provides clearer response guidelines and fallback behavior. The documentation has been reorganized to emphasize core principles for fact-checking and citation, while also documenting the fallback to online documentation when the local skill is unavailable. This ensures consistent, reliable guidance regardless of documentation availability.
