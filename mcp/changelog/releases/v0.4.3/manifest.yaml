title: Tenzir MCP Server v0.4.3
intro: >-
  This patch release updates the server to use FastMCP's built-in logging infrastructure.
  The custom file-based logging has been removed, eliminating the creation of `tenzir-mcp.log`
  files in the working directory. Use `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose output
  when troubleshooting.
