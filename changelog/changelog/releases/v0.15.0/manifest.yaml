title: Enhanced Release Publishing
intro: >-
  This release adds new options to the `release publish` command for more flexible
  release automation. You can now prevent GitHub from marking a release as latest
  with `--no-latest` (useful for backport releases), and automatically commit staged
  changes before tagging with `--commit`.
