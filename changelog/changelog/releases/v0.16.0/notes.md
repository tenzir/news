This release introduces aggregated module changelog summaries in release notes, allowing parent projects to automatically include a summary of changes from their modules. It also fixes a minor issue with redundant version fields in JSON output.

## 🚀 Features

### Aggregated module changelog summaries in release notes

For projects with modules, parent releases now automatically include a summary of module changes. Each parent release manifest records the module versions at release time, enabling incremental tracking—subsequent releases only show new module entries since the previous parent release.

Module summaries appear after the main changelog, separated by a horizontal rule. Each module section shows its version and lists entries in compact format: emoji prefix, title, and byline.

## 🐞 Bug fixes

### Remove redundant version field from JSON entry objects

The JSON output of `release notes --json` previously included a redundant `version` field in each entry object. Since all entries in a release share the same version as the top-level manifest version, this duplication was unnecessary. The `version` field has been removed from individual entries, with the version information now available only at the top level of the JSON payload.
