title: Version-Agnostic Workflows
intro: >-
  This release introduces a version-agnostic release workflow that simplifies publishing
  and CI integration, allowing commands to default to the latest release version.
  It also improves changelog browsing by sorting module entries chronologically rather
  than grouping them by project.
