We improved the clarity and usability of Explorer charts. Legends are now collapsible, easier to read, and support filtering series directly. Pie chart legends adapt better to available space, and tooltips provide clearer information.

We also expanded the chart color palette for better visual distinction between series, fixed bar chart x-axis labels overlapping when there are many data points, and refined chart layout and behavior for a smoother overall experience.
