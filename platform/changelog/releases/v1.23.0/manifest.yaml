title: "CORS fixes and Frontend Updates"
intro: >-
  The seaweedfs service in our example setups now runs as non-root user and automatically adds the correct CORS headers. Be sure to read the \"Changes\" section below if you're using it in a self-hosted environment. As always, a slew of frontend improvements are included in this release as well.
