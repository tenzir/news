Pipeline pausing is a rarely used feature, and its support will soon be removed from nodes, so we've updated the UI, and no longer show the pause buttons in the pipeline detail page, and the multi-select pipeline actions.

If a pipeline is already paused, it can still be found in the pipeline list, and is categorized by the status widget as a "stopped" pipeline.
