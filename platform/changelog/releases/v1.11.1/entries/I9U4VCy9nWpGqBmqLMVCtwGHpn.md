The selected node, and the tab you're viewing, are now part of the page URL, which has the following consequences:

1. You should now stay where you were when reloading the page
2. Copying links, bookmarking, etc. is now possible.
3. Some links into the app might have broken, but most will redirect to the right place.
4. Previously created pipeline share URLs will not work anymore.
