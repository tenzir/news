intro: >-
  This release improves the pipeline detail view with faster loading and a convenient
  close button for quick navigation. Error messages are now cleaner with collapsible
  technical details, and we fixed issues where the UI could hang or become unresponsive.
  This release also includes security hardening for standalone deployments, including
  server-side token storage, configurable security headers, and Content Security Policy
  support.
